# 🚀 Launch Materials

This document contains all the materials needed for launching Changelog Automator across different platforms.

---

## 📱 Reddit - r/SideProject

### Title
I automated changelogs so you never write RELEASE_NOTES.md again

### Body
**The Problem:**

Writing changelogs eats hours every month. Most devs skip them → users ignore repos without changelogs → fewer stars/adoption. It's a vicious cycle.

**What I Built:**

Changelog Automator - a GitHub App that uses Claude AI to auto-generate changelogs from your commits. Push to main → CHANGELOG.md updates automatically.

**How It Works:**

1️⃣ Install the GitHub App (one click)
2️⃣ Push to main branch
3️⃣ AI parses commits → generates Markdown changelog → auto-commits to your repo

**Demo:** [30-second GIF showing before/after]

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Anthropic Claude for AI
- Vercel Serverless
- Built in 4 weeks

**Pricing:**
- Free: 50 commits/month
- Pro: $9/month unlimited

**Try It:** https://yourapp.vercel.app

I'm using it on 3 of my own projects already. Would love feedback from fellow solo devs!

## 💼 LinkedIn Post

### Hook
I spent 6 hours every month writing changelogs. Last month, I automated it with AI.

### Body
Every developer knows the pain:

You ship an amazing feature. Users want to know what's new. But writing release notes takes hours you'd rather spend coding.

So I built Changelog Automator - a GitHub App that uses Claude AI to auto-generate changelogs from your commits.

**How it works:**
→ Install the GitHub App (2 minutes)
→ Push to main branch
→ AI parses commits, generates Markdown, auto-commits to repo

**The Results:**
✅ Zero manual changelog writing
✅ Beautiful, consistent formatting
✅ Users actually read them now
✅ More GitHub stars & adoption

**Built with:**
- Next.js 14
- Anthropic Claude
- Vercel Serverless
- TypeScript

Free for 50 commits/month. Pro plan ($9/mo) for unlimited.

If you're a solo dev shipping OSS or side projects, this one's for you.

### First Comment
Hey Product Hunters! 👋

I built Changelog Automator because I was spending 6+ hours every month writing changelogs for my side projects. As a solo dev, that's time I'd rather spend coding.

**The journey:**
Built this in 4 weeks following a strict MVP approach. No dashboard, no complex features - just install the GitHub App and it works.

**Current status:**
- 100% functional webhook system
- AI-generated changelogs with Claude
- Free tier: 50 commits/month
- Already dogfooding on 3 repos

**What's next:**
Based on your feedback, I'm considering:
- Custom templates
- Slack notifications
- Team features (if there's demand)

Would love your thoughts! What's your biggest pain point with changelogs?

Hey [Name],

Quick question: How many hours did you spend writing changelogs last month?

If you're like me, it's too many. That's why I built Changelog Automator - a GitHub App that uses AI to auto-generate changelogs from your commits.

**Here's how it works:**
1. Install the GitHub App (2 minutes)
2. Push to main branch
3. AI generates your changelog → auto-commits to repo

That's it. Zero manual work.

**Free for 50 commits/month.**
